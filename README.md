# C# Tutorial – Move an Image using Drag and Drop in Windows Form

Move an image with drag and drop is kind of important for many games and applications. We wanted to demonstrate a project where you can move an image in windows form with drag and drop. We want to do this using the dynamically drawn image on the screen. We will link a rectangle to the drawn image on the screen and use that to detect clicks and drags in the windows form. You can use any image of your choice for this tutorial. We are using the two images from the tutorial, you can download them from the link below.
